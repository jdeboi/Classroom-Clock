The Classroom Clock is a clock designed and optimized for teachers. When I began teaching, I found it very difficult to keep track of the rotating block schedule. Classroom Clock solves this problem, in addition to offering several other convenient features:

1. An additional digit that keeps track of the block or period- an especially useful feature for rotating block schedules
2. The ability to program holidays into the code to prevent the block from advancing on days when school is not in session
3. LED digits fade from green to red as the end of the period or block approaches so that a single glance can convey the remaining class time 
4. A countdown timer triggered 6 minutes before the period ends that flashes between the time and the remaining time, a useful feature for signaling cleanup time
5. Other light effects that can be triggered during lunch, free periods, after school, or other special occasions 

But the possibilities are endless! How will you program the classroom clock?​
